# cssproj
An application for managing the faculty admission contest - project for CSS.

First of all I recommend you to create a virtualenv inside the project, so there will be no conflicts with other python libraries you have installed on your computer.

After that you can install there all the needed python libraries in order to properly run the project.


In file requirements.txt you'll find the required packages in order to run the project.
The command to install the requirements is:

<strong>pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt</strong>
